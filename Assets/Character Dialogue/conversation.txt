monk: I demand a full refund!

tinker: Here's the money I owe you.
// tinker does a forward animation at this point just to keep the scene interesting.
// monk exits
//teapot spawns, then after a short period turns into a badger
badger: I was in hot water there for a second!
badger: Thank goodness I'm out of that dreadful temple!
tinker: Why do you have to be a spirited teapot?
tinker: That sale was the only business I have had for months
tinker: I'll be bust out of even this shack at this rate...
badger: I know! I can be a travelling tanuki!
badger: People will flock for miles to see the amazing show we put on!
badger: Just keep me away from that awful fire...
// scene fades to town: crowds of people gather around the tinker and the badger.
// badger does little jumps, crowd does little jumps too
// scene fades to the "performance" scene.
