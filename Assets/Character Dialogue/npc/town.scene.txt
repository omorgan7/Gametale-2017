"Lovely day today isn't it?"
"I heard the head monk broke his kettle"
"Have you heard the awful racket in the wood?"
"Lovely day for a walk in the woods"
"Gosh you're looking grubby. Wash your clothes!"
"Bit strapped for cash? I heard the monk bandying about something"
"Oh, my kettle has gone rusty. I'd pay top dollar for a replacement"
