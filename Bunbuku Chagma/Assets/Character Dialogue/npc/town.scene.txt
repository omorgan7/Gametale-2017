"Lovely day today, isn't it?"
"The monk has been complaining about his kettle all day."
"Have you heard the strange noise coming from the wood?"
"Lovely day for a walk in the woods!"
"What's that smell? Wash your clothes!"
"Business slow? You could try asking at the temple."
"Oh, my kettle has gone rusty. I'd pay good money for a replacement."
